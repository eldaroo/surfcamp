Santa Teresa’s coastline runs barely eight kilometers, yet it squeezes in more character than most entire regions. Use this spot-by-spot download to choose your peak based on tides, skill level, and vibe.

## Playa Santa Teresa (Main Peak)

- **Skill level:** Beginner–Intermediate
- **Bottom:** Sand with shifting inside bars
- **Sweet spot:** Mid to high tide with light offshore wind
- **Why paddle out:** Plenty of peaks, forgiving shoulders, and immediate access to rentals, lessons, and cafés.
- **Secret sauce:** Walk five minutes north or south before paddling. Tiny rip bowls hide between main crowds.

## Playa Carmen

- **Skill level:** Longboarders & cruisers
- **Bottom:** Sand with scattered rock outcrops—watch your toes at low tide
- **Sweet spot:** Low to mid tide
- **Why paddle out:** Silky walls tailor-made for logging, mellow channel for easy returns, and sunsets worth the paddle alone.
- **Travel tip:** If the main break is blown out by noon, Carmen often keeps a light texture but stays surfable.

## Playa Hermosa

- **Skill level:** Solid intermediate–Advanced
- **Bottom:** Mix of sand and reef; strong rips on bigger days
- **Sweet spot:** Mid tide rising
- **Why paddle out:** Punchy rights and lefts over defined sandbars, plus less crowd pressure when it gets heavy.
- **Coach insight:** Take a foil board or step-up when south swells meet longer-period energy—you’ll find draining barrels.

## Manzanillo

- **Skill level:** Intermediate once you understand the reef markers
- **Bottom:** Reef shelf with defined channels
- **Sweet spot:** Mid tide, small to medium swell
- **Why paddle out:** Playful walls, bright turquoise water, and the feel of a secret spot despite being right up the road.
- **Getting there:** Rent a quad or hop in a taxi and keep gear minimal—parking is limited near the fishing village.

## How to Read the Coastline Fast

1. **Wind compass:** If the trade winds swing onshore by late morning, surf north (Carmen/Manzanillo) or south (Hermosa) depending on protection.
2. **Tide tracker:** Install a tide app with push alerts; Santa Teresa moves a lot of water and shifts the character of each peak hourly.
3. **Sandbar scouting:** Watch at low tide the day before you surf. You’ll see rip channels, newly formed banks, and easier paddle-outs.
4. **Respect the locals:** A smile, a timely “buenas”, and smart positioning go further than you’d imagine.

Tag this guide in your notes and bounce between peaks like a local. The more coastline you explore, the quicker you’ll find your signature Santa Teresa wave.
