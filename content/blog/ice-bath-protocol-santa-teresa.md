Cold plunges sharpen awareness and speed recovery between double sessions. Follow this ritual to soak safely and soak up the benefits.

## Pre-Plunge Setup

1. **Hydrate + fuel:** Sip coconut water and eat a small carb-rich bite 30 minutes before to avoid lightheadedness.
2. **Breath rehearsal:** Three rounds of 30 nasal breaths followed by a 15-second hold primes the diaphragm and calms nerves.
3. **Intention check:** Name why you’re plunging—maybe resilience, faster recovery, or stress relief.

## Entering the Tub

- **Step slowly:** Keep shoulders back, eyes soft, and maintain nasal breathing. Sudden movements spike adrenaline.
- **Hands on heart:** A gentle press reminds you to soften ribs and expand the back body.
- **Timer sweet spot:** 2–3 minutes at 6–8 °C (43–46 °F) is plenty for surfers already training hard.

## During the Hold

- **Anchor breath:** Inhale for four counts, exhale for eight. Longer exhales signal safety to the nervous system.
- **Scan body:** Relax jaw, unclench fists, drop shoulders, and imagine warmth radiating from your chest.
- **Mantra:** Repeat “calm body, calm mind” or similar words to override panic reflexes.

## Rewarming Flow

1. **Controlled push-ups:** 10 slow reps to kickstart circulation.
2. **Horse stance breath:** Deep inhales with arm swings to build heat internally.
3. **Contrast rinse:** Alternate warm and cool shower bursts if needed, but let the body generate its own heat first.

## Weekly Structure

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Monday | Post-dawn surf plunge for alertness |
| Wednesday | Midweek recovery + journaling session |
| Saturday | Community plunge paired with live drum meditation |

## Safety Essentials

- Skip plunges if you’re pregnant, dealing with uncontrolled blood pressure, or recovering from acute injuries.
- Always have a buddy spotting you and a warm towel waiting nearby.

Cold water is a mirror—stay patient, breathe deeper, and watch how resilience in the tub translates to resilience in heavy sets.
