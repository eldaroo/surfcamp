Progress isn’t luck—it’s structure. Our coaching method threads high-level analysis with soulful stoke so every surfer leaves with measurable wins. Here’s the framework we rely on week after week.

## 1. Personal Baseline

- **Land assessment:** Flexibility, stance, pop-up mechanics, and breath control.
- **Water check:** We film your first two waves to capture natural instincts before layering cues.
- **Goal board:** Clear intentions (e.g., “link my first cutback” or “stay calm in overhead surf”) anchor every session.

## 2. Focused Skill Blocks

- **Wave-reading labs:** Beach walks at low tide to map sandbars and rips.
- **Drill sessions:** Repetition-based paddling, compression-extension, and rail-engagement exercises.
- **Equipment testing:** Swap fins, adjust tail pads, or try alternative outlines to unlock new feelings on the wave.

## 3. Tech-Driven Feedback

- **Video breakdowns:** Slow-motion replays, side-by-side comparisons, and telestrator markups deliver “aha” moments.
- **Wearables:** GPS watches track paddle efficiency and wave count so progress becomes data-backed.
- **Daily debriefs:** 10-minute evening recaps highlight wins and micro goals for the next paddle-out.

## 4. Mindset & Recovery

- **Breathwork protocols:** Box breathing for pre-surf nerves and down-regulation techniques post-sesh.
- **Mobility prescription:** Surfer-specific flows to protect shoulders, lower back, and knees.
- **Integration circles:** Sharing breakthroughs around the fire cements confidence.

## What a Week Looks Like

| Day | Focus | Takeaway |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Monday | Baseline filming | Identify quick wins + longer-term goals |
| Tuesday | Wave reading + compression drills | Harness speed more efficiently |
| Wednesday | Video review + alternate boards | Expand maneuver options |
| Thursday | Breathwork + paddle intervals | Boost endurance under load |
| Friday | Progress test + celebration surf | Document improvement and celebrate |

The result? Surfers head home with new lines, stronger bodies, and a repeatable toolkit they can apply at their home break.
