A dialed surf trip starts long before you touch sand. Use this checklist to keep your Santa Teresa mission light, organized, and ready for every tide swing.

## Boards & Surf Hardware

- **Two-board quiver:** Daily driver + step-up or groveler depending on season. Local repairs are fast, but backups keep you surfing.
- **Travel fins & hardware:** Pack two fin sets, fin key, spare screws, and thin baseplate for soft-top rentals.
- **Leashes:** 6' for shortboards, 8' for funboards, and a spare—even mellow closeouts can snap a tired cord.
- **Board protection:** Sock or day bag to shield against dust on quad rides; add pipe insulation around rails for flights.

## Health & Comfort Kit

- **Sun armor:** Long-sleeve rashguard, mineral sunscreen, zinc for lips/nose, aloe, and polarized shades.
- **Tropical medicine:** Electrolyte packets, charcoal pills, small first-aid kit, ear drops, and reef-safe bug spray.
- **Recovery tools:** Lightweight stretch strap, lacrosse ball, and travel roller. Santa Teresa sessions pile up fast.

## Travel Logistics

1. **Documents:** Passport valid 6+ months, digital insurance proof, copy of return flight, and reservation details.
2. **Connectivity:** eSIM or local Kolbi chip + offline maps for the Nicoya Peninsula.
3. **Cash flow:** ATMs exist but occasionally empty—carry a few hundred USD in crisp bills to exchange in town.
4. **Transport:** Reserve a 4x4 or quad early in high season. For greener months, confirm shuttle pickups in case roads wash out.

## Week-Of Game Plan

- **Three days out:** Check swell models (Surfline, Windy) and tides; adjust board selection before you leave home.
- **Travel day:** Pack essentials + fins in carry-on, download playlists/podcasts for the ferry drive, and hydrate.
- **Arrival day:** Walk the beach at low tide to spot rips, banks, and photo-worthy peaks. Schedule first lesson or guided paddle.
- **Midweek tune-up:** Book a video coaching session or breathwork reset to keep energy high.

## Optional Upgrades

- **Waterproof film camera:** Santa Teresa’s golden-hour sessions deserve analog memories.
- **Compact drone:** Capture empty lineups from above—just respect wildlife sanctuaries and no-fly zones.
- **Portable power bank:** Charge phones, GoPros, and surf watches anywhere.

Check this list twice, travel lighter than you think, and you’ll have all the tools to chase every tide swing without sweating the details.
