A great retreat day balances adrenaline with introspection. Here’s how we choreograph every sunrise-to-sunset moment so you can progress in the water and feel deeply restored on land.

## Sunrise Activation

- **05:45 Wake-up call:** Soft bells and fresh ginger tea on your casita porch.
- **06:00 Mobility flow:** 20-minute dynamic stretch led by our surf coaches to open shoulders and hips before paddling.
- **06:30 Surf intel circle:** Coaches break down tides, sandbars, and safety zones using drone footage captured the day prior.

## Morning Surf Session

- **Guided paddle-outs:** Groups of four or fewer surfers head to the optimal peak for their skill level.
- **In-water coaching:** Live cues through BB Talkin’ headsets plus GoPro follow cams on select waves.
- **On-beach feedback:** Immediate playback with tips on stance, line choice, and breathing.

## Midday Reset

- **Farm-to-table brunch:** Tropical fruit, gallo pinto, plant-based protein, and homemade sourdough.
- **Rest pods:** Hammocks shaded by palms, Normatec boots, and contrast showers to keep legs fresh.
- **Mindful journaling:** Prompts focused on gratitude, goal tracking, and emotional release.

## Afternoon Yoga & Workshops

- **Flow menu:** Rotate between vinyasa, yin, and mobility classes depending on how heavy the surf felt.
- **Special topics:** Breathwork 101, freedive equalization drills, nutrition deep dives, or sustainability chats with local activists.
- **Creative moments:** Board art jam sessions, shell foraging walks, and cacao ceremonies.

## Sunset Session & Community Table

- **Optional second surf:** Chase pastel skies at Playa Carmen or longboard laps at Manzanillo.
- **Golden-hour yin:** Slow floor-based practice to lengthen the spine and cool the nervous system.
- **Shared dinner:** Family-style plates of fresh fish, hearty veggies, and Costa Rican staples, followed by live music or stargazing.

Every ritual has a purpose: build confidence in the lineup, soften the edges of stress, and foster a community where vulnerability feels natural. Whether you’re here for one week or a full month, the rhythm keeps you progressing without ever feeling rushed.
