Holding your breath in heavy water starts on land. These drills keep our surfers composed when the sets stack up.

## Nervous System Primer

- **CO₂ tolerance vs. O₂ efficiency:** Most wipeout anxiety stems from CO₂ buildup, not lack of oxygen, so we train to stay calm as CO₂ rises.
- **Diaphragm awareness:** Learning to expand laterally instead of chest-breathing preserves energy during long paddles.

## Daily Breathwork Stack

1. **Box Breathing (5 x 5):** Inhale 5, hold 5, exhale 5, hold 5. Repeat for five minutes upon waking to stabilize baseline.
2. **CO₂ Tables:** Exhale holds that gradually lengthen; perfect for teaching the mind that urge-to-breathe is just a signal, not an emergency.
3. **Step-Ups + Breath Holds:** Walk stairs or do air squats, exhale fully, then hold while moving slowly—mimics paddling under duress.
4. **Ocean Simulation:** Float on your board, inhale calmly, fall off intentionally, then practice two relaxed strokes before surfacing.

## Integrating with Surf Sessions

- **Pre-surf:** Three minutes of coherent breathing (inhale 4, exhale 6) lowers heart rate before big paddle-outs.
- **Between sets:** Single nasal inhale, extended exhale, then micro shoulder rolls to keep tension low.
- **Post-session:** 10 slow belly breaths in the shade + journaling how each hold felt. Tracking wins prevents fear from rewriting the story.

## Measuring Progress

| Drill | Week 1 | Week 3 | Goal |
|-------|--------|--------|------|
| Static exhale hold | 35 sec | 55 sec | 70 sec |
| 4-count paddle breath cycles | 6 reps | 10 reps | 12+ reps |
| Recovery heart rate (1 min post wave) | 118 bpm | 102 bpm | <100 bpm |

## Safety Notes

- Train with a buddy; never push max breath holds in the ocean without supervision.
- Stop if tingling or dizziness appears, and always recover with deep nasal breaths.

Consistent practice shrinks fear, extends patience in the pocket, and lets you stay present for the joy of every ride.
