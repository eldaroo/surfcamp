Santa Teresa never really turns off, but each part of the year carries a distinct personality. Use this quick guide to align your skills, expectations, and stoke level with the season that suits you best.

## Dry Season (December – April)

- **Morning glass-offs:** Consistent offshore winds from sunrise until late morning create dreamy shoulders and clean faces.
- **Larger South Pacific pulses:** Long-period swells light up the outer sandbars and reefier corners of Hermosa.
- **Crowd watch:** Holiday breaks and March travel waves fill the peaks, so dawn patrols or lesser-known access paths pay off.
- **Best for:** Beginners who want predictable conditions and intermediates ready to scale up board size or hunt for barrels.

## Green Season (May – November)

- **Super consistent surf:** Shorter-interval swells stack up, delivering playful peaks through most of the day.
- **Afternoon showers:** Tropical clouds usually wait until after lunch, leaving warm, moody lineups and empty beaches.
- **Budget friendly:** Lodging, boards, and vehicles are easier to score, making longer stays realistic.
- **Best for:** Progressing surfers who want reps, and advanced riders chasing powerful late-season swells (September–October is bonkers).

## Month-by-Month Cheat Sheet

| Month | Typical Surf | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Jan–Feb | Chest to overhead, super clean | Classic vacation window; reserve boards early |
| Mar–Apr | Shoulder to double overhead | Combo of Southern Hemi pulses + crowd pressure |
| May–Jun | Waist to overhead, playful | Less busy, great for coaching-focused trips |
| Jul–Aug | Chest to head high | Rain increases but so do tube chances |
| Sep–Oct | Head high to well overhead | Peak power, lightning-fast barrels |
| Nov | Chest to shoulder, rebuilding sandbars | Transition month with glassy mornings |

## How to Choose Your Week

1. **Set your goal.** Learning? Aim for January–March or May–June. Chasing power? Late September is money.
2. **Watch the tides.** Santa Teresa’s beach breaks love mid tides—book lodging close enough to jog down when the tide hits the sweet spot.
3. **Talk to locals.** Message our team a week out and we will tell you which peaks are sanded in, where new rips formed, and when to be in the water.
4. **Pack for sun and rain.** Even December delivers tropical downpours, so combine zinc, breathable layers, and dry bags.

## Final Paddle-Out Tips

- Book a 6:30 AM coaching session on day one to lock in timing and safety zones.
- Stack two boards or an alternate fin set in case the sandbars change overnight.
- Treat every afternoon storm as regeneration time—breathwork, gentle mobility, or an ice bath keeps you ready for the dawn patrol.

Pick your week with intention, and Santa Teresa will reward you with the kind of waves that keep you smiling long after you dry off.
