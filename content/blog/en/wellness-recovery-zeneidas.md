Surfing twice a day doesn’t have to equal burnout. Our on-site recovery hub keeps surfers and yogis energized throughout the week.

## Movement Lab

- **Mobility wall:** Follow color-coded sequences targeting shoulders, thoracic spine, and ankles.
- **Balance toys:** Indo boards, BOSU balls, and slacklines to fine-tune stabilizers between sessions.
- **PT drop-ins:** Local physiotherapists host office hours to tweak warm-ups and treat nagging pains.

## Hydro & Heat Circuit

- **Cold tubs:** Stainless-steel plunges with consistent 6 °C water.
- **Infrared sauna:** 30-minute sessions to flush out lactic acid; pair with guided breathing for extra calm.
- **Rainforest shower:** Open-air rinse with herbal soaps grown on property.

## Nutrition & Hydration

- **IV lounge:** Optional Myers’ cocktails and electrolyte drips overseen by licensed nurses.
- **Recovery bar:** Smoothies with collagen, adaptogens, and locally roasted coffee.
- **Chef collabs:** Pop-up dinners with nutritionists focusing on anti-inflammatory plates.

## Nervous System Reset

- **Sound baths:** Crystal bowls and jungle field recordings melt away travel stress.
- **Guided naps:** Weighted blankets and noise-canceling headphones inside the “cocoon room.”
- **Acu-massage:** Combo sessions blending acupuncture, cupping, and deep tissue work.

## Integration Rituals

- **Progress journaling:** Sticky-note wall celebrating breakthroughs (first green wave, longest hold-down, etc.).
- **Community fires:** Share the biggest lesson of the day and plot tomorrow’s goals.

Whether you’re prepping for another round at Playa Hermosa or integrating a profound yoga class, the recovery hub keeps your body humming and your stoke steady.
