# The Complete Surf Guide to Santa Teresa, Costa Rica

Santa Teresa has earned its reputation as one of Costa Rica's premier surf destinations—and for good reason. This once-sleepy fishing village on the southern tip of the Nicoya Peninsula now attracts surfers from around the world, drawn by consistent waves, warm water, and a laid-back beach town vibe that's hard to find anywhere else.

Whether you're a complete beginner looking for your first wave or an experienced surfer seeking perfect barrels, this guide will give you everything you need to know about surfing Santa Teresa, Costa Rica.

## Why Santa Teresa is a World-Class Surf Destination

**Consistent Waves Year-Round**

Unlike many surf destinations that have distinct on and off seasons, Santa Teresa offers rideable waves throughout the entire year. The Nicoya Peninsula's unique geography creates multiple surf breaks that work in different swell and wind conditions, meaning you'll almost always find a good wave somewhere along the coast.

**Warm Water & Perfect Climate**

The Pacific Ocean here maintains a comfortable 26-28°C (79-82°F) year-round. You won't need a wetsuit—most surfers wear boardshorts or a rashguard for sun protection. The tropical climate means sunny days, palm trees swaying in the breeze, and that classic Costa Rica "pura vida" atmosphere.

**Surf Breaks for Every Level**

One of Santa Teresa's greatest strengths is its variety. You'll find mellow beach breaks perfect for learning, intermediate waves for progressing your skills, and powerful reef breaks that challenge even advanced surfers. This diversity makes it an ideal destination for groups with mixed skill levels or surf camps offering progressive coaching.

## Best Time to Surf Santa Teresa

### Dry Season (December - April)

The dry season is peak tourist season in Costa Rica, and for good reason:

- **Consistent offshore winds** in the morning (5-10 AM)
- **Sunny days** with minimal rainfall
- **Larger swells** from South Pacific storms
- **Ideal for beginners** due to cleaner conditions
- **Crowded lineups** at popular breaks

**Pro tip:** Wake up early to catch the best conditions before the wind picks up and crowds arrive.

### Green Season (May - November)

Don't overlook the green season (formerly called "rainy season"):

- **Fewer crowds** at all surf spots
- **Excellent waves** during May-June and September-October
- **More affordable** accommodation and services
- **Afternoon rain showers** (usually brief)
- **Lush, vibrant landscape**

The rain typically falls in the afternoon, leaving mornings clear for surfing. You'll often have world-class waves with just a handful of people out.

## Santa Teresa Surf Spots: Your Complete Breakdown

### Playa Santa Teresa (Main Break)

**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
**Bottom:** Sandy beach break
**Best Tide:** Mid to high
**Best Wind:** Light offshore (mornings)

The main Santa Teresa beach stretches for several kilometers, offering multiple peaks along its length. This is where most surf schools operate, and it's perfect for learning. The sandy bottom is forgiving for beginners, while the variety of peaks means you can find less crowded sections even during high season.

**Why surf here:**
- Consistent waves for beginners
- Multiple peaks reduce crowding
- Surf schools and board rentals nearby
- Safe, sandy bottom
- Easy paddle-out

### Playa Carmen

**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
**Bottom:** Sand and some rock
**Best Tide:** Low to mid
**Best Wind:** Light offshore

Just north of the main Santa Teresa break, Playa Carmen offers a slightly more mellow vibe with equally good waves. The beach is beautiful, the waves are consistent, and you'll find fewer crowds than at the main break during peak season.

**Why surf here:**
- Less crowded than Santa Teresa main
- Beautiful setting
- Good for progression
- Consistent small to medium waves

### Playa Hermosa

**Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Bottom:** Reef and sand
**Best Tide:** Mid
**Best Wind:** Offshore

Located south of Santa Teresa, Playa Hermosa lives up to its name (Beautiful Beach). This spot offers more powerful waves breaking over a mix of reef and sand. It's best suited for surfers with solid experience who can handle a bit more power and navigate reef breaks safely.

**Why surf here:**
- More powerful, hollow waves
- Less beginner traffic
- Beautiful, secluded setting
- Great for progressing intermediate surfers

### Mal País

**Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Bottom:** Rocky reef
**Best Tide:** Mid to high
**Best Wind:** Light offshore

The rocky point at Mal País creates one of the area's most consistent and high-quality waves. This right-hand point break can produce long, clean rides when conditions align. It's more challenging than the beach breaks and requires confidence navigating rocks and reef.

**Why surf here:**
- Long, quality rides
- Consistent even in small swells
- Right-hand point break (less common in CR)
- Experienced surfers only

### Manzanillo

**Level:** Advanced
**Bottom:** Reef
**Best Tide:** Low to mid
**Best Wind:** Offshore

This is the heavy wave of the area. Manzanillo breaks over a shallow reef and can produce barreling waves that demand respect and skill. Only attempt this spot if you're an experienced surfer comfortable with reef breaks and powerful waves.

**Why surf here:**
- Barrel opportunities
- Powerful, challenging waves
- Less crowded (due to difficulty)
- For advanced surfers only

## Essential Tips for Surfing Santa Teresa

### 1. Respect the Locals

The local surf community in Santa Teresa is generally welcoming, but showing respect goes a long way:

- Don't snake waves or drop in on others
- Wait your turn in the lineup
- Give a friendly "hello" or "gracias" to other surfers

The waves in Santa Teresa can be deceptively powerful. If conditions look beyond your skill level:

- Ask locals or instructors for guidance

Like any beach break, Santa Teresa can develop rip currents. Know the signs:

**If caught in a rip:** Don't panic or swim against it. Paddle parallel to shore until you're out of the current, then angle back to the beach.

### 4. Protect Your Skin

The equatorial sun in Costa Rica is intense:

- Use reef-safe sunscreen (SPF 50+)
- Wear a rashguard or surf shirt
- Reapply sunscreen after each session
- Consider a hat for before/after surfing
- Stay hydrated

### 5. Bring or Rent the Right Equipment

**Beginners:**

- Rashguard
- Reef-safe sunscreen
- Surf wax (warm water formula)

**Intermediate/Advanced:**
- Shortboard or fish (based on conditions)

- Your preferred wax

**Renting locally** is easy and affordable in Santa Teresa, with multiple surf shops offering daily and weekly rates.
