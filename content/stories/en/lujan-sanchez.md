## The Arrival

When Luján first arrived at Zeneidas Surf Garden, she was seeking something more than just a vacation. At 44, with a successful dental practice back in Argentina, she felt the pull toward something different—a chance to reconnect with herself and nature in a way that her busy professional life hadn't allowed.

Santa Teresa welcomed her with its characteristic warmth: the sound of waves crashing against the shore, the rustling of palm trees in the ocean breeze, and the genuine smiles of the Zeneidas community. What she thought would be a two-week escape turned into the beginning of a profound transformation.

## The Surf Journey

Luján had never surfed before arriving in Santa Teresa. Standing on the beach with her board for the first time, she felt a mix of excitement and nervousness that reminded her she was truly alive. The patient instruction from the Zeneidas surf coaches made all the difference—they understood that learning to surf isn't just about technique; it's about building confidence and trust in yourself.

Her first successful ride wasn't the longest or the most graceful, but it changed everything. "The moment I stood up on that board and rode that wave all the way to shore, I felt something shift inside me," Luján recalls. "It wasn't just about surfing anymore—it was about proving to myself that I could still learn, still grow, still challenge myself at this stage of my life."

The progression came naturally. Morning sessions became sacred time, her body adapting to the rhythm of the ocean, her mind learning to read the waves. The video analysis sessions with her coach helped her refine her technique, but more importantly, they showed her how much progress she was making, even when it didn't feel obvious in the moment.

## Community & Connection

What surprised Luján most wasn't the surfing—it was the people. The Zeneidas community became a second family, a diverse group of individuals from around the world, all drawn together by a shared love of the ocean and a desire for authentic connection.

"The people, the connection with nature, the surf..." she often says when trying to explain what makes Santa Teresa special. But it's more than that. It's the morning yoga sessions where you share space with both beginners and experienced yogis. It's the shared meals where conversations flow as freely as the local wine. It's the ice bath sessions where you push through discomfort together and emerge stronger.

The friendships formed here are different from those back home. There's an openness, a vulnerability that comes from being away from your normal life, from challenging yourself daily, from being present in a way that modern life rarely demands.

## Beyond Surfing

While surfing became her passion, Luján discovered that Zeneidas offered so much more. The morning yoga sessions helped her develop a flexibility and mindfulness she never knew she needed. The breathwork classes taught her techniques she now uses in her dental practice to manage stress and stay centered.

The ice bath therapy, initially intimidating, became one of her favorite rituals. "There's something powerful about choosing discomfort," she explains. "In the ice bath, you learn that you're stronger than you think, that discomfort is temporary, and that on the other side of that challenge is growth."

The ceramic workshops provided an unexpected creative outlet. Working with clay, she found a meditative quality that balanced the intensity of surfing. Creating something beautiful with her hands reminded her of the precision work she does as a dentist, but without the pressure—just pure creative expression.

## The Decision

Three weeks into what was supposed to be a two-week stay, Luján found herself making a life-changing decision. She extended her trip. Then extended it again. Eventually, she had to face the truth: she didn't want to leave.

The conversations with other long-term residents at Zeneidas inspired her. They had made the leap—restructured their lives to spend more time in Santa Teresa, or like some, moved here permanently. If they could do it, why couldn't she?

## A New Chapter

Today, Luján splits her time between Argentina and Santa Teresa, having restructured her dental practice to allow for extended stays in Costa Rica. She's become part of the Zeneidas extended family, someone new guests often turn to for advice and inspiration.

Her mornings start with surf sessions where she's now mentoring beginners, sharing the same encouragement that her coaches gave her. Her afternoons might include yoga, working on ceramic pieces in the studio, or simply sitting at one of Santa Teresa's beaches, watching the sunset paint the sky in brilliant colors.

## Lessons Learned

When asked what she's learned from her transformation, Luján's response is thoughtful: "I learned that it's never too late to start something new, to challenge yourself, to change direction. I learned that community is everything—that surrounding yourself with positive, adventurous people elevates your own life. I learned that nature has a way of putting things in perspective, of showing you what really matters."

She pauses, looking out at the ocean. "And I learned that home isn't always where you start—sometimes it's where you find yourself."

## Your Journey Awaits

Luján's story is unique, but it's not unusual at Zeneidas Surf Garden. Many guests arrive seeking a break from routine and discover something deeper—a new passion, a community, a different way of living. The magic of Santa Teresa is that it meets you where you are and shows you where you could be.

Whether you're looking for a week of adventure, a month of transformation, or the beginning of a new chapter in your life, Zeneidas provides the space, support, and community to make it happen. As Luján proves, it's never too late to ride your first wave or to discover where you truly belong.
